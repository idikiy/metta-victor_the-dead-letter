				<p epub:type="title">The Little Guest and the Apparition</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>I went to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll’s to the Christmas dinner. I was surprised to meet Eleanor in the family group; for, though she now frequently joined the home circle, I thought that on this holiday her own loss would press upon her with overwhelming weight. Instead of this, I saw a light in her countenance which it had never before worn; her face, totally devoid of smiles or color, yet shone with a serene and solemn luster, the most touching, the most saddening, and yet elevating, of any expression I had ever seen upon human features. My intense sympathy with her taught me how to translate this new phase of her mind; I felt that, in those mystic vows which she had taken upon herself with a spirit, she had derived a comfort; that she joyed in the consciousness that she was now and from henceforth evermore the bride of him who waited for her in the mansions of the Heavenly country. This life was transient⁠—to be meekly borne a little while alone⁠—then she would go to him who awaited her in the only true and abiding home. I, and I only, looked upon her as the wife of Henry Moreland, as sacredly as if he were her living partner. I only was fitted, by the power of my own passion and suffering, to appreciate her position, and the feelings with which she now returned to her friends, to play such a part in life as duty still pointed out. I can not explain with what an emotion of reverence I took and pressed the little, attenuated hand which she placed in mine.</p>
			<p>There had been, as yet, no change in Eleanor’s demeanor toward me. Whether I imagined it in the rest of the family, or whether they had changed, this much was still certain, and gave me the deepest pleasure I could now know: Eleanor was the same to me as she had ever been⁠—the benignant, gentle sister, who loved and trusted me as a dear brother⁠—more dear than ever since I had given such proofs of my devotion to her cause⁠—since she could not but see how my very heart was wrung with the pain which tore her own. As long as she continued to treat me thus, as long as I could give her one smallest atom of pleasure in any way, I felt that I could bear anything from the others. Not that there was anything to bear⁠—nothing⁠—nothing, except that indefinable air which a sensitive spirit feels more keenly than any open slight. The new year was now approaching; it would be the most natural time for entering into new business relations; I felt that if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll intended to offer me the partnership, he would do it then. If he did not⁠—I must look out for myself⁠—I must go away.</p>
			<p>The Christmas dinner was the sumptuous feast which it always had been, the old housekeeper having taken it into her own hands. She, to judge by her provision, felt that such kind of painstaking would be a relief to the general gloom. No guests were invited, of course. It was touching to see how the servants persisted in placing every imaginable delicacy before Miss Eleanor, which she could not, by any possibility, even taste. A cup of coffee, with a piece of bread, made up her slender Christmas feast. Yet it was a joy to her father to have her at the table at all. Mary’s affectionate glances continually sought her face; parent and sister both felt relieved and comforted by its tranquil expression.</p>
			<p>James, too, was cheerful; he would have been brilliant had an opportunity offered. I, who read him tolerably well, knew that it was the sight of Eleanor’s tranquillity which had inspired him⁠—and that he did not understand that saintly resignation as I did.</p>
			<p>In the course of the conversation around the table, which I did my best to make cheerful, I happened to speak of Lenore Burton. It was not the first time I had mentioned her, always with such enthusiasm as to excite the interest of the ladies. Mary asked me many questions about her, finally turning to her sister, and saying,</p>
			<p>“You were always so fond of children, Eleanor. May I not send for this beautiful little girl to spend a few days with us?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly, Mary, if you think you would like her company.”</p>
			<p>“Do you think her father would trust her to us a little while, Richard?”</p>
			<p>“He can be persuaded, without doubt.”</p>
			<p>After we had left the table, Mary came to me, with much animation, to whisper her ideas about the proposed visit; she thought the sight of an agreeable, lovely child about the house might interest Eleanor more than any thing else possibly could, and would, at least, delight her father, who was drooping under the silence and mourning in his home. I quite agreed with her in her opinions, deciding to write that evening a pressing plea to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton, promising the most careful attention to his frail little household blossom which a trusty housekeeper and loving friends could extend. I would come down to the city for her, and attend her dutifully on her little journey, if his consent was given, and Miss Lenore herself approved the action.</p>
			<p>The next day I had an answer. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton wrote that Lenore was delighted with the invitation, and that he accepted it the more willingly, as he was called unexpectedly to Boston, where he should be absent a week or ten days, and that he had not liked leaving his daughter so lonely during the holidays. He added that he was obliged to leave that morning; but I might come for Lenore at any time; I would find her ready; and that, upon his return from Boston, he would come up to Blankville after her; closing his note with polite thanks for our friendly interest in his little girl, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Thus every thing was satisfactory. The third day after Christmas I went down, in the morning, to New York, returning in the afternoon with my little treasure, who was brimful of happiness, enjoying the ride with the zest of childhood, and confiding herself to my guardianship with a joyful content, which awakened my tenderest care in response. This artless faith of the child in the providence of the grown-up man it is which brings out the least selfish part of his character, bowing his haughty, hardened nature to minister to the humblest of its confiding wants.</p>
			<p>The sisters both came into the hall to receive their little visitor. They took her into the parlors, bright with chandelier and firelight, unhooding and uncloaking her before the grate. I was anxious to witness the impression she made, for I had been so lavish of my praises, as to run the risk of creating a disappointment.</p>
			<p>It was impossible to be disappointed in Lenore. She made conquest of the whole family in the half-hour before tea. It was not her exquisite beauty alone, but her sweet expression, her modest self-possession amid her stranger-friends, enhancing its effect. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll brightened as I had not lately seen him; every other minute Mary would repeat the welcome of her little guest with another kiss, declaring, in her pretty, willful way, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Richard was not going to monopolize Miss Lenore because he was the oldest acquaintance⁠—Lenore having chosen her seat by my side, with her hand nestled in mine.</p>
			<p>James was not in the house; he did not come home until some time after we had taken our tea⁠—drank his alone in the dining-room⁠—and joined our circle quite late in the evening. As he came in we were sitting about the fire. Lenore had gone, of her own inclination, to Miss Argyll’s side, where she sat on a low stool, with her head against the lady’s lap. She made a gay picture as she sat there, framed around with the black of Eleanor’s garments. Her traveling-dress was of crimson merino, and her cheeks⁠—what with the ride in the cold air, and the glow of the present fire, were almost as red as her dress; while her golden curls streamed in shining strands over the sable habiliments against which she rested. She was replying archly to some teasing remark of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll’s, and I was thinking what a brightness she would give to the dull house, when James came forward, holding out his hand, with one of his pleasantest smiles, saying,</p>
			<p>“This is the little lady, is it, whom we have been so anxiously waiting to see? Can I be introduced, cousin Mary, or does not the Queen of fairies allow herself to make the acquaintance of ordinary mortals?”</p>
			<p>You have noticed, reader, how some little cloud, floating in the west at sunset, will be flushed through with rosy light, and how, instantly, while you gaze, it will turn gray, losing every particle of radiance. So the child changed when he approached and spoke to her. Her cheeks faded to a gray whiteness; her eyes were riveted on his, but she could not smile; she seemed to struggle with some inward repugnance and her sense of what courtesy demanded; finally she laid her little cold hand in his, without a word, suffered him to kiss her, and, clinging close to Eleanor, remained pale and quiet⁠—her gayety and bloom were alike gone. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll could not rally her⁠—she shrunk like a sensitive plant.</p>
			<p>“If that pallid, stupid little creature is the marvelous child Richard promised us, I must say, he has shown his usual good taste,” commented James in an aside to Mary. He was not flattered by the reception he had met.</p>
			<p>“Something is the matter with her, James. She is wearied with her journey. I am afraid we are keeping her up too late. She was gay enough a little while since.”</p>
			<p>“Are you tired? Would you wish to go to bed?” whispered Miss Argyll.</p>
			<p>“If you please,” she replied, with an air of relief.</p>
			<p>“You are not getting homesick so soon?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll.</p>
			<p>“I am not; I like it here very much,” answered Lenore, candidly. “Something is the matter with me now, sir, and you must please excuse me. My head began to ache just now⁠—so I suppose I had better go to bed.”</p>
			<p>She bade us good night with a smile so restrained that I felt afraid she was not going to enjoy her visit. Eleanor herself took her away to the maid who was to attend upon her, and did not return to us until her little guest was in bed.</p>
			<p>“Come, Mary, let’s drop the baby question, and play chess,” said James, impatiently, as we discussed the visitor; “I’m tired of the subject.”</p>
			<p>“Wait until tomorrow, and you will become interested too,” she responded.</p>
			<p>“I like hearty little bread-and-butter girls,” said he, “but not such die-away misses as that. She looks to me as if she read Coleridge already. Children should be children, to please me.”</p>
			<p>The repulsion was mutual. I, only, had noticed the strange effect wrought upon my pet by a sight of James, and knowing, as I did, the peculiarities of her temperament, it had astonished me, and aroused my curiosity. By the ill-humor with which he received any allusion to Lenore, I believed that James himself was conscious that the pure eyes of the child looked straight into the darker chambers of his heart, and was frightened by what she saw there. A young man who was gambling away his uncle’s property upon the credit of a daughter’s hand which he had not yet won, could not have a very easy conscience; and it was not a pleasant thing to be reminded of his delinquencies by the clear eyes of an innocent child. As he became absorbed in his game of chess, I sat studying his countenance, and thinking of many things. I wondered if his uncle and cousins were not aware of the change which was coming over him; that reckless, dissipated look which writes certain wrinkles in a young man’s face, overwritten in his by outer smiles, which could not hide the truth from a discerning eye. I asked myself if I could justify my course in keeping silence about what I had seen; it was my plainest duty to inform <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll, not only on his account, but on James also. Such a knowledge, coming to his uncle, though it would be terribly mortifying to his nephew, might be the means of breaking his new fetters of habit before they were riveted upon him. Such, I felt, was my duty. At the same time, I shrunk from it, as a person situated as I was naturally would shrink; I was liable to have my motives misconstrued; to have it hinted that self-interest was prompting me to place James in a bad light. No, I couldn’t do it! For the hundredth time I came to this conclusion, against the higher voice of the absolute right. I was glad to strengthen myself in my weak course by remembering that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton had requested my silence, and that I was not at liberty to betray his confidence. Looking at him, thinking these things, with my thoughts more in my eyes than they ought to have been had I been on my guard, James suddenly looked up and encountered my gaze. He pushed the board aside with an angry motion, which overthrew half the men and entirely disconcerted the game.</p>
			<p>“Well, how do you like my looks, Richard?” the defiant eyes glittering with a will which overpowered my own, smiling a deadly smile which threatened me.</p>
			<p>“How peevish you are, James! I believe you threw up the game because you saw I was checkmating you,” cried his cousin.</p>
			<p>“That’s it, my dear child; I never would allow myself to be checkmated!”</p>
			<p>“Then you shouldn’t play!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, sometimes I allow women to win the game; but when I play with men, I never give up. The man who attempts the chances with me must prepare for defeat.”</p>
			<p>“How generous you are to the witless sex,” said Mary, sarcastically. “I am much obliged to you, that you sometimes allow us to win. Just pick up that castle you have sent tumbling in ruins, if you please, sir⁠—and don’t ask me to play chess for at least a fortnight.”</p>
			<p>I perceived a threat in his words of which the girl was quite innocent; he was throwing down the gauntlet to <em>me</em>; again and again his air, his words, were such that I could put no other construction upon them. He was determined to misunderstand me⁠—to look upon me as a person seeking to injure him. I was in his way⁠—I must get out of it. This was the manner he put on to me. I felt that night, more than ever, the conviction that my connection with the Argylls was about to be broken. If James felt thus toward me, I should be unwilling to take a position which he regarded as belonging, of right, to himself. Worse than all, I felt that his treacherous nature was working secretly against me, and that his efforts had already told upon those whose love and respect was most precious to me.</p>
			<p>Shortly after, I took my leave; he was so engrossed, with his back toward me, looking over some old engravings, that he did not turn to say good night. My room at my boardinghouse had a particularly cheerless air that evening; I felt lonely and embittered. My heart ached for sympathy. I resolved that, if a partnership was not offered on New Year’s, I would propose a visit to my mother, for whose love and encouragement I longed. The event of going away, too, would give <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll the opportunity of declaring himself in one way or another.</p>
			<p>Lenore’s visit was a decided success⁠—in the way, too, which I had hoped for. Her fine and spiritual nature was drawn toward Eleanor in a manner which made the latter love her, and grow to feel a consolation in the touch of the little hand, the unsought kiss, and the silent sympathy which brought the child to sit hours by her side, saying nothing, but looking with wonder and reverence at a sorrow too deep for her young heart to fathom. Lenore frolicked with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll, chatted and sung with Mary; but she was always ready to leave either for her quiet corner by Miss Argyll. Mary pretended jealousy, though we were all glad to see the interest Eleanor took in the child. One of our greatest pleasures was in Lenore’s singing. I have mentioned the purity and great compass of her voice. To hear her sing some of Handel’s music, of a Sabbath twilight, was almost to obtain a glimpse into the heaven toward which her voice soared. I saw Eleanor quietly weeping while she sung, and I knew the music was loosening the tense strain upon her heart-chords.</p>
			<p>I was interested in watching two things⁠—first, the attachment between Miss Argyll and Lenore; secondly, the persistent effort of James to overcome his first aversion, and his ultimate success. By the second day he had mastered his chagrin at the evident dislike of the child, who could hardly compel herself to be polite to him, and who grew constrained and pale whenever he was near her. James Argyll was not the man to allow a child to slight him with impunity. His indolence was a repugnance to business and study; it was no weakness of the will, for when he set his resolves upon an object, he usually accomplished it. I saw that he had resolved to conquer Lenore. He paid court to her as if she were a “lady of the land,” instead of a little girl; on New Year’s he overwhelmed her with splendid presents; he took her out sleigh-riding with him, in a fancy cutter, which he declared was only just large enough for those two, with chimes of silver bells and a spirited horse. I ought not to have felt grieved that Lenore, also, like the rest of the world, proved faithless to me. But I did. I was more hurt by her growing indifference to me and her increasing fascination for James than the subject warranted. I should have known that rides and dolls, flowers and flatteries, and a dainty little ring for her forefinger, would win any little maiden of eleven; but I had estimated Lenore’s character higher. I had noticed her attractions and repulsions, the former always toward noble and true persons⁠—the latter toward the unworthy. Now, however, my little bird was charmed by the serpent’s eye; she was under the influence of James’ will, and I resigned her.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>About ten days after my visit to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott, I kept my promise to her, by returning to inquire about the present condition of Moreland villa. I saw, as soon as I entered the cottage, that her mind was preyed on by the same convictions which had troubled her on the former occasion.</p>
			<p>“If there ain’t at least one ghost in that house, then there never was such a thing, and there never will be⁠—now! You’ve seen for yourself there ain’t a human being in it⁠—<em>and there is something</em>! I’ve seen it and heard it, and you can’t convince a person against them two senses, I reckon.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t want to convince you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott; I only want to convince myself what this thing is which you have seen and heard. Have you had any new revelations?”</p>
			<p>“I’ve seen the death-light once since, standing over the house; we saw it, too, shinin’ out of that room⁠—John and I saw that together. We was so set on findin’ out whether it was spirits or not, we mustered up courage to go through the house ag’in the next day, and as sure as you’re settin’ there, <em>something</em> had been back and laid down on that bed ag’in⁠—something light, that scarcely made a dent⁠—you needn’t tell me’t was any human mortal, which it wasn’t. We’ve heard children cryin’, too, which is an evil omen, the dream-book says; an’ to clap the climax, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Redfield, there’s no use keepin’ it back⁠—<em>we’ve seen the ghost</em>!”</p>
			<p>I was now as interested as the woman could desire; she had stopped, mysteriously, after making this grave declaration, and sat looking me in the eyes. I returned her gaze with one of silent inquiry, leaning a little forward in my chair. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott smoothed her apron absently, with her large hands, still looking into my eyes, as if she saw the ghost in their distending pupils. I made up my mind that I was going to hear either something of ridiculous shadowyness magnified into an apparition, or something which would give some tangible clue to the mystery, if there was a mystery, of Moreland villa.</p>
			<p>“You have been fortunate,” said I. “What was it like, pray?”</p>
			<p>“You’ve noticed there was a little balcony under the windows of Henry’s room?”</p>
			<p>“I know there is such a balcony.”</p>
			<p>“It was there we saw it. You know how bright the nights have been lately, with the full moon and the snow. John and I walked out, night before last, to the front of the villa, to see what we could see⁠—and there it was! It was as light as day, and we both had a good look at it. I don’t know how long it might have stayed if I hadn’t screamed. John clapped his hand over my mouth to stop me, but he was too late; it sort of riz right up and disappeared.”</p>
			<p>“But what was it like⁠—man, woman, or child?”</p>
			<p>“It was like a ghost, I tell you,” replied the housekeeper, stoutly. “I s’pose sperits are dressed purty much alike in the next world, whether they’re men or women. We read in the Bible of the white robes⁠—and I’ve never heard of a spook that was dressed in any other way. It may have been Henry in his shroud, for all I know⁠—that’s what I believe it was⁠—there now!”</p>
			<p>“Henry was never dressed in a shroud,” I answered, gravely; “he was buried in a black-broadcloth suit. So you see that you were not correct there.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Redfield, we can’t understand these things⁠—it isn’t given to us. I can tell you what John and I saw, and you can make up your own mind. There was a shape, on the balcony, standing straight up, white all over. A long white garment hung from its head to its feet; its face was turned up to the moon, and its arms were raised as if it prayed. It’s eyes was wide open, and it’s face as pale as a corpse’s. John and I will both make our affydavit to it, in court, if it’s necessary.”</p>
			<p>“Where did it go to when it disappeared?”</p>
			<p>“It seemed to me to turn into the air; but that I wouldn’t be so sure about. John thought it went right through the side of the house.”</p>
			<p>“Was the window open behind it?”</p>
			<p>“Wal, really now, I wouldn’t swear that it was, or wasn’t. The fact is, I was so scaart the minit I saw it, I like to have dropped. John was for staying ‘to see if it wouldn’t come ag’in,’ but I wouldn’t let him, so we both cut and run.”</p>
			<p>“I am sorry you didn’t use your eyes to better advantage.”</p>
			<p>“When you see a thing like that, I reckon you’ll run, too. It ain’t at all likely the window was open, or we would have noticed it. It was all shut up the next mornin’, the same as ever.”</p>
			<p>“That was yesterday. I suppose you have not been in the villa since?”</p>
			<p>“Lord! no, sir. I wouldn’t go now for a hundred dollars.”</p>
			<p>“Have you noticed anything else peculiar?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir. There’s been footsteps around the house in the snow.”</p>
			<p>“Indeed?” I said, eagerly; “that is more like something. Can I see them now?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir; the sun’s melted ’em all off. But if you think they’re the tracks of persons comin’ about the house for any purpose, just tell me, will you, sir, how they happened to be just about the porch, and so on, and not a track to it, nor away from it, in no direction?”</p>
			<p>“Indeed, I can not explain it, until I’ve rooted out the mystery from the beginning.”</p>
			<p>“Nor it can’t be explained,” cried the housekeeper, triumphantly.</p>
			<p>It worried her to think I was so skeptical when she had given such absolute proofs; the idea of the haunted villa was making her really sick, yet she would not give up her cherished belief in its being haunted. I think she would have been disappointed if anyone had come forward and sworn himself the ghost.</p>
			<p>I sat a little while pondering her statements. There had been nothing, on the former occasion, to convince me that any intruder, human or spiritual, had been in the villa⁠—except the shadowy imprint of a form on Henry’s bed, and for the proof that it had not been made before the house was cleaned up, I had nothing but her word. As for the death-light and the wailing sounds, I conceived that, in that lonesome, solitary place, two persons of the class to which these belonged, with their excited imaginations reäcting upon each other, might easily persuade themselves of such marvels. Even in this last statement, that both of them had clearly and distinctly seen a white form on the balcony of the room, I did not find much to disturb me. There is nothing better for producing all kinds of shapes and phantoms to a frightened or superstitious eye, than a bright, moonlight night. It is far better than the deepest darkness. The earth is full of weird shadows; the most familiar objects take on an unnatural appearance in the gleaming rays, enhanced in their strange effect by the black, fantastic shadows which stretch away from them. Add to this, a garment of snow spread over everything. The landscape on which we have rested our gaze, every day, for years, under these circumstances will be as novel to us, as if it were a bit of scenery transplanted from some strange and far country. A vivid fancy, predisposed to the work, can make an excellent ghost out of a rosebush or a fence-post⁠—a fearful apparition out of the shadow of a cornice heaped with snow. In the present case, not only were the man and his wife in that feverish state in which the eye makes visions for itself, but they were quite ready to link such phantoms with Henry’s room, which they had previously decreed to be the favorite abode of the ghost. A review of the whole case led me rather to be vexed with them, than satisfied there was any reason for the mental “stew” into which they had heated themselves. The only tangible things of the whole medley were⁠—the footprints. If there were actually traces of feet walking about the premises, that was enough to satisfy me⁠—not of a ghost, but of a person, engaged in prying about the villa for some unlawful purpose. I made up my mind to watch for this person, and entrap him. It occurred to me, at once, that one of those daredevil spirits, to be found in every community, was purposely getting up scenic effects on the premises, for the amusement of spreading the report that the villa was haunted, and exciting the gossip and credulity of the village. I was indignant at the heartlessness of the plan, and resolved, should I catch the perpetrator, to inflict such summary chastisement, as would cure him of his taste for practical joking. The assertion of the woman that the tracks began and ended nowhere⁠—that no one had approached the house, because there were no footsteps coming in from any direction⁠—did not receive entire credit from me. Were that actually the case, then, it was positive evidence that the person was secreted in the dwelling⁠—an idea foolish and incredible on the face of it, for many reasons.</p>
			<p>However, I was in earnest, now, about the matter; I would ascertain the truth or explode the falsehood, and make an end of it, before painful reports should reach the ears of friends, or every idle ragamuffin in the country make that hallowed place, consecrated by the ties and memories of the one now gone, the focus of his vulgar curiosity.</p>
			<p>“Where is your husband?”</p>
			<p>“He’s sortin’ pertaters, or tyin’ up seeds, in the loft.”</p>
			<p>“Please call him down, and give me the keys of the house.”</p>
			<p>The gardener came, following very reluctantly, at my bidding, while I again entered the villa, and went over every room, stationing him in the hall, so that no one could possibly escape during my visit to the lower and upper floors. I searched from cellar to garret, while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott, with her pale-blue eyes wide open, and affecting a bustling bravery which her looks belied, accompanied me. Once, at a sudden noise, she seized the skirts of my overcoat, but resigned them when I told her it was caused by John’s shutting the front hall-door.</p>
			<p>“Dear! dear! there’s rats in the villa, at last!” she exclaimed, removing the cover of a flour-barrel which stood in the storeroom. “They’ve been in this flour! I’m sorry, for they’re an awful pest. They’ll make trouble if I don’t watch ’em clost. I believe I’ll pizen ’em. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Moreland told me to take this flour home and use it up; but we haven’t needed it yet, and I’ve left it here, and now they’ve made pretty work with it.”</p>
			<p>“If there are rats here, I shan’t be surprised at all kinds of noises,” I remarked. “Rats are equal to almost anything. They will tramp like an army of men, or stalk like a solitary burglar. They will throw down plates and cups⁠—like this one, broken on the floor here, since we came here last; muss pillows and drag books out of place. You really will have to keep a sharp lookout.”</p>
			<p>“They won’t cry like a child, nor moan like a sick person, nor stand on balconies dressed in shrouds!” observed the housekeeper.</p>
			<p>“I think they would do the first two,” and I smiled, “but as to the latter, I’m not prepared to assert.”</p>
			<p>“I reckon not. I only wish you’d seen it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Redfield.”</p>
			<p>“I shall stay tonight in the hope of that pleasure, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott.”</p>
			<p>“I’m right glad to hear you say so, sir. It’s not pleasant to be placed in the situation I am⁠—to know what I know, and not to have my word taken.”</p>
			<p>It was true; it could not be pleasant for her to have her earnest statements received with so much skepticism; I did not wonder that she felt hurt, almost offended; at the same time I felt as if I, in my turn, should be intensely aggravated if I found out there was nothing in all this flurry.</p>
			<p>This second search resulted in nothing, like the first. It was nearly dark when we returned to the cottage, where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott allowed me to dandle her fat, good-natured baby, Johnny, while she prepared tea in a style befitting the important occasion of “company.”</p>
			<p>“If you’re in earnest about sittin’ up to watch, I’ll make coffee, instid of tea, if it’s agreeable to you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Redfield. It’s better to keep one awake.”</p>
			<p>I assented to this assertion, being of a similar opinion myself. She set her husband to grinding the delectable berry in a hand-mill, and soon an excellent supper, with cold ham and hot biscuits, was placed upon the table. The night promised to be clear and cold; the moon would not rise until about eleven; I fortified myself against the hardships of my adventure by two cups of strong coffee, with a substantial meal; passed an hour or two chatting with the couple and singing Johnny to sleep; then, about eight o’clock, I buttoned my overcoat close, tied my muffler about my neck, and went forth to begin picket-duty.</p>
			<p>“I’ll leave the coffeepot on the stove, and a good fire,” was the parting promise of the good woman, who seemed to think I had rather a solemn time before me.</p>
			<p>“Thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott; if I make no discoveries by one or two o’clock, I shall come in to warm myself, and give up the hope for this occasion. You know midnight is the witching-hour⁠—it will be useless to stay much later.”</p>
			<p>“The Lord be with you,” she said, earnestly.</p>
			<p>Armed with a stout walking-stick, with which I intended to inflict punishment upon any intruder of earthly mold, I walked out on the lawn, taking such a survey as I could in the dim light; like the rain in the children’s riddle, I went “round and round the house,” and finally took station on the front porch, where I walked softly back and forth, listening for sounds within and without. I heard and saw nothing. The long hours slipped slowly away. Just before moonrise the darkness seemed to deepen, as it does before dawn. My intention was to take up some position on the lawn, where, unseen myself, I could command the approaches to the villa, and also have a view of Henry’s room, with the balcony. It was time now to secrete myself, before the approaching moon should reveal me to the person or persons who might themselves be on the watch. Accordingly, I selected a seat on the little rustic bench, completely encircled with bushy evergreens, which not only concealed my person, but afforded me considerable protection from the cold. I can not, to this day, breathe the pungent odor of the spicy trees, without recalling the experiences of that night. A silence, like that which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Kane speaks of as one of the most impressive features of the long Arctic night, brooded around; over against the hills came gradually stealing the silvery luster of the rising moon, while the valleys yet lay in profoundest gloom; the dimly glimmering stretches of snow broadened into whiter fields; the picturesque villa, with its turrets and porches and pointed roof, stood black and quiet before me. I could hear a dog barking afar off, as it were some dream-dog barking in some dreamworld. I had almost forgotten the cause of my being there, at that strange hour, in that lone spot, gazing at that dark mass of building, empty of life and warmth as was <em>her</em> heart of joy or hope; the intense cold, the odor of the pines and hemlock, the trance of thought into which I had fallen, were benumbing me.</p>
			<p>Suddenly I saw a shapeless and shadowy brightness hovering amid those dark turrets. It was the death-light of which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott had told me. A warm thrill ran through my fingers and toes, arousing me to the keenest consciousness. I watched it flutter and move⁠—stand still⁠—flutter again⁠—and disappear. It lasted perhaps three minutes. In that time I had made up my mind as to the mysterious appearance⁠—it was the light of a lamp or candle being carried about in a person’s hand. That was what it most resembled; but who carried it, and how was the reflection thrown <em>there</em>, over the roof? There was certainly a mystery about this which, had I been at all superstitious, or even nervous, would have unfitted me for any further cool investigation. I resolved that if I could not master the marvel then, I would do it by the light of day. I watched intently, hoping it would reäppear, and give me some glimpse of its origin. While I waited, a ray of light pierced through the shutters of Henry’s room. I will acknowledge that for one single instant the hand of the dead seemed laid on my heart; it turned cold, and refused to beat. The next, I smiled grimly at myself. I had never been a moral or physical coward. The solution of the mystery was now in my grasp, and I had no idea of letting it slip. I was confident that some person was playing the mischief in the deserted house; but if I had really expected to confront the inhabitants of another world, I should not have hesitated. The key of the main entrance was in my pocket; I walked swiftly to the house, unlocked the door as softly as possible, and grasping my stick firmly in my hand, sprung up the stairs. It was quite dark in the house, although it was now light out of doors; in my haste, I hit my foot against a chair at the bottom of the stairs, and overthrew it. I was provoked, for I wished to come upon these midnight prowlers unawares. Knowing just where the room was situated, I went directly toward it; it was very dark in the upper passage, all the blinds being closed; I groped for the handle of the door⁠—something rustled, something stirred the air⁠—I flung the door open. There was no light in it. All was dark and silent. Before I could fling the shutter open, letting in a peaceful flood of silver moonlight, my hope of detecting the intruder was almost at an end. I was certain that something had passed me in the obscurity of the hall; I had been conscious of that subtle magnetism which emanates from a human form, perceived in the blackest night. It might be the magnetism of soul instead of body, and a disembodied spirit might have sent the same electric current through me. At all events, I had now nothing for my labor. I did not think that another journey over the house would result in any discovery, since the warning had been given; I had no lamp or lantern with me; I reluctantly, after lingering and listening some time in vain, closed the room and the house, and returned to the cottage, where I drank the coffee which awaited me, laid down on a buffalo-robe before the stove, and slept away my vexation.</p>
			<p>I was not very communicative as to my adventures when eagerly questioned by my entertainers the following morning. They were satisfied, by my very reticence, that I had seen something to puzzle me, and were both alarmed and triumphant. In answer to their inquiries, which they were too respectful to press, I assured them that I had reason to think, with them, that the villa required attention. I had not been able to satisfy myself who was disturbing the premises; but that I should not rest until I knew. I should return that night and sleep in the villa; I wished to enter it very quietly, probably before dark, so as not to alarm the inmate or inmates; and I was confident that I should thus be able to pounce upon the ghost. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Scott regarded me with admiring awe.</p>
			<p>“She wouldn’t go for to sleep in that house alone for all the riches of Solomon,” and wouldn’t I, at least, provide myself with pistols?</p>
			<p>When I went into <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll’s office that morning, he greeted me with marked coldness. At last I could not conceal from myself that, not only had his manner changed, but that he wished me to feel that it had. He gave me, as I entered, a searching, suspicious glance, saying, “Good morning, Richard,” in the most formal tone. Nothing further. I took up a book, hiding my pain and embarrassment in an attempt to read; but my mind was not on the legal difficulties expounded therein; I was wondering at the causes of the situation in which I found myself. A hanger-on! yes, an unwelcome hanger-on in an office where I no longer had any conceded rights⁠—in a home where I was no longer trusted.</p>
			<p>“Has <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Argyll placed a spy on my actions? Does he know already that I was out the entire night? and does he judge me before he has an explanation?” I asked myself, indignantly. “If he thinks I am forming bad habits, doing wrong in any respect, why does he not remonstrate with me⁠—give me a chance to defend myself?”</p>
			<p>I had intended to take his advice in the matter of the haunted house; but now I sat, angry and silent, feeling, oh, so wounded and forlorn. I did not stay long in the office; going to my room, I wrote a long letter to my mother, telling her I should come soon to pay her the visit which should have been sooner made had I not been engrossed with the duty to which I had vowed myself.</p>
			<p>Yes! I had pledged my own heart to devote myself to the discovery of Henry Moreland’s murderer; and if Eleanor herself had put her foot on that heart, and crushed it yet more, I do not know that I should have held my vow absolved.</p>
			<p>I should not have gone to the mansion that day, had not a message been sent, late in the afternoon, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton had arrived, and expected me to meet him at tea. I went; and had the pleasure of seeing little Lenore enthroned by the side of James, who attended upon her as if she were a princess, and of being treated with bare civility by all save <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton. Miss Argyll was ill, and did not come down.</p>
			<p>I saw the observant eye of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burton watching the intimacy between his daughter and her new friend; whether he was pleased or not, I could not decide; the eye which read the secret thoughts of other men did not always betray its own impressions. I was certain, too, that he observed the change in the demeanor of the family toward me, and my own constrained manner.</p>
